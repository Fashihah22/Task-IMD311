	<p>When you see me in a person, you can already tell that I am an energy and active person just by looking at my face reaction and action. When I start some work, I can't stop it in such a short time. I can also be a talkative person when it comes to the explaination or give an opinion. It is because I like people to hear my thought and I also willing to hear their answer back and accept their opinion.</p>
